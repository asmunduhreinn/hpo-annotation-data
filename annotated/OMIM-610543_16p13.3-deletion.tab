MIM:610543	CHROMOSOME 16p13.3 DELETION SYNDROME			del16p13.3		HP:0001452	Autosomal dominant contiguous gene syndrome									PCS							Reported as a contiguous gene syndrome. The critical region is limited to the 5' end of CREBBP. OMIM lists CREBBP, DNASE1 and TRAP1 but PMID:17855048 shows that not all severe RSTS patients have deletions that contain those genes. It could be limited to CREBBP or extend in the other direction to impact ADCY9, etc. I didn't add genes to this phenote file but we can update this to report what you think is accurate.
